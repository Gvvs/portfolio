            <h3>My studies</h3>
            <p>
              I wrote my first code in VisualBasic Scripts after learned it in middle school at 13 years old. After High school, i started to learn medecine for 5 years. I passed my first year competition successfully and i was able to finished <b>55th out of 1040 candidates</b>.
              I worked at the hospital as a medical extern for 3 years, but my addiction for coding and making things was not compatible with.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to stop my medical studies to learn more about coding, computing, and technologies at <a href="https://www.hetic.net" title="HETIC - école des métiers du web" target="_blank">HETIC</a>. I entered directly in the 4th year of the
              <a href="https://www.hetic.net/formations/grande-ecole" title="HETIC - La grande école de l'internet" target="_blank">HETIC great school</a> where I polish my knowledge about the world wide web.
            </p>
            <h3>What i do</h3>
            <p>I am <b>freelancer</b> and work for some people and communications agency. Added to my coding knowledge, i have 2 years of SEO practice and web analytics which is an asset for my clients. I am also attracted by connected objects maked with
              <b>Arduino and Raspberry PI</b>.</p>
            <h3>What i love</h3>
            <p>
              I love to learn, to improve myself, to build things, to play some blues guitar riffs, vintage things, to run under the storm, to talk about the universe, to read scientific articles and so on.

            <h3>What is it</h3>
            <p>
              According to my passion to play the guitar, and to love vintage sounds, i built entierely a vintage guitar tube amplificator (no this is not about HTML AMP format...). I got on the web the reel 1962's 5F2A layout and schematics writed at the age by Fender.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the parts are <b>new in box</b> (NIB), which means built nearly in 1960, never used, and with same specifications as possible. Only the metal cage, the transformer, the tweed tolex and the speaker are new or not made by myself.
            </p>
            <h3>How i did</h3>
            <p>
              I analyzed and studied the components, bought all the parts on about 15 differents place based on USA, Australia, Paris, and Great Britain. I make a new 3D layout to build the massiv wood box. I soldered all the parts on the bulletin board, pasted the
              tweed tolex on the wood box, and <b>switch ON</b> !
            </p>
            <h3>What did it becomes</h3>
            <p>
              This tube AMP is still in my living-room with my <b>pre-CBS Fender stratocaster</b>, and it like to caress my ears.

          <section>
            <h3>What is it</h3>
            <p>
              I wanted to practice <b>C++ language</b> and make a reel project with an <b>Arduino</b>. So i decided to make from scratch a 130 liters freshwater aquarium with his own electric system, an Arduino controller and a touchescreen integrated
              into the furniture for the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Arduino controller was able to manage the <b>internal temperature</b> and the <b>hydrogen potential</b> of the water, the intensity and the wavelenght of the <b>led lighting</b>, the injection of <b>liquid fertilizer</b>, it was able
              to <b>fedding fish</b> and to automatically <b>renew the
              water</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>More details</h3>
            <p>
              Potential hydrogen of the water was controlled by a <b>solenoid valve on a carbon dioxide cylinder</b>, and was measured by a pH probe. The led lighting has been studied by myself to <b>match with true cycle of photosynthesis</b>, and true
              cycle of intensity and wavelenght of the sun rays, taking into account the attenuation due to the height of water. Injection of liquide fertilizer, and the renewal of water was managed by <b>peristaltic pumps</b>. The fish feeder was mechanical
              and maked by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this was configurable without exception with the touchscreen user interface. Even the intensity in lumens and the wavelenght in Kelvin of each LED, minutes by minutes.
            </p>
            <h3>What did it becomes</h3>
            <p>
              I sold this project cause it was finished, and it's less funny when there is nothing more to do.

            <p>
              I worked for <a href="https://www.margotduvauchelle.fr" title="Margot Duvauchelle, psychologue clinicienne à Amiens" target="_blank">Margot Duvauchelle, a clinical psychologist in Amiens</a>, who wanted to <b>start his liberal carrier</b> after having worked at
              the hospital. She wanted to have a digital strategy to have patients quickly and make herself known. She also wanted to know if i could do some workflow optimizations, especially for it's accounting and to prevent cancellations of appointments.
            </p>
            <h3>In summary</h3>
            <p>
              First of all, i spent a lot of time <b>analyzing</b> his competition, <b>best search queries</b> in it's area, and to find a compromise between the <b>digital marketing</b> and the <b>ethic</b> imposed by its profession and herself. Then i started
              the development of her website, paying attention to <b>search engine optimizations</b>. During this time, i started the <b>social media and referer strategy</b>, the local SEO, and give her a lot of advice to make usefull web contents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then i started the workflow optimizations. I make an <b>automatic accounting software</b> coded in JavaScript, connected with her Google calendar and her Google contacts, let she have usefull statistics, turnover, taxe declaration and predict how much the URSSAF
              will take from her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, to prevent cancellations of appointments, i did an other automatic software that sends sms to her patients 2 days before their appointments.
            </p>
            <h3>Debriefing</h3>
            <p>
              Her website stay at the first or the second search engine results position (on the 4 best queries) and she can no longer take a patient. Cancellations are low compared to the average. She is angry because she spends too much time on the phone.
